Functions
---------


`avEdges(g, dist)`
:   Takes in a graph and a districting plan and returns the average number of edges in a district


`avSpanningTrees(g, dist)`
:   Takes in a graph and districting plan and returns the average number of spanning trees in a district for a specific plan


`createGraph(s)`
:   Creates a random graph of size s


`edgesBetween(graph, sGraph)`
:   Takes in 2 graphs, where one is a subgraph of the other, and returns the total number of edges leaving the subgraph
    The subgraph is the second argument for the function


`edgesInDists(g, dist)`
:   Takes in a graph and a specific districting plan and
    returns the total # of edges in a plan that are within districts


`mostEdges(g, dist)`
:   Takes in graph and a districting plan, finds the two districts with the largest number of edges,
    then returns the total number of edges in these districts and between them


`numDifferentGroups(g, plans)`
:   Takes in a graph and the list of all districting plans and returns the number of different probability groupings for a graph
    (number of different total number of edges in districts)


`productLeavingEdges(g, dist)`
:   Takes in a graph and a districting plan and returns the products of edges leaving districts in a plan


`randomPlanar(x)`
:   Will return a random planar nx graph with x nodes that was created using delaunay triangulation


`smdEdges(g, dist)`
:   Takes in a graph and districting plan and returns the sum of differences between total edges in a district and the average
    (finds standard mean deviation for number of edges in districts)


`smdTrees(g, dist)`
:   Takes in a graph and districting plan and returns the sum of differences between total spanning trees in a district and the average
    (finds standard mean deviation for number of spanning trees in districts)


`varianceEdges(g, dist)`
:   Takes in a graph and districting plan and returns the variance of number of edges in districts


`varianceSpanningTrees(g, dist)`
:   Takes in a graph and districting plan and returns the variance of number of spanning trees in districts
